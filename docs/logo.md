# Logo

So I want a cool abstract logo and the concept of "Transmutation" is such a cool
one that it gives me a lot to work with. While browsing for transmutation
circles, I discovered the below links which could be really fun:

 - [**Basic
   Alchemy**](https://notshurly.deviantart.com/art/Transmutation-Circle-Tutorial-158371530?offset=50#comments):
*Speaks to the "construction" of a transmutation circle*
 - [**Alchemy Tutorials and
   Instruction**](https://notshurly.deviantart.com/gallery/25365806/Alchemy-Tutorials-and-Instruction):
*Lots of technical details on Alchemy which could help inspire the logo*
 - [**Alchemy Gallery from
   Notshurly**](https://notshurly.deviantart.com/gallery/23303244/Alchemy):
*Sample Transmutation Circles that Notshurly has created*

The links above give instruction on a fiction around a science for building
transmutation circles for **Alchemy**. Many are saying it is a mix of **Fullmetal
Alchemist** and real **Alchemy**. I love the idea of it and I want to design a
logo based on this science that speaks to the concepts of **Transmutation**.

I really need to watch **Fullmetal Alchemist** now. :\
