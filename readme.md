# Transmutation

Enhanced promises for immutable data processing, inspired by RxJS and Lodash.

## NOTICE: Active Development

**Transmutation** is still in its early stages of development. Feel free to watch
this project as it grows and use the issues section to put in any questions or
idea you may have.

*Nothing in this project promises to be stable until we reach `v0.1.0`.*


## Install

**Pick one** - *Listed in order of recommendation*

```bash
yarn add transmutation
npm install --save transmutation
npm i -S transmutation
```


## Usage

See the [`tests/`](./tests/) directory for examples of how **Transmutation**
works. At least until real documentation on usage is available.


## Work Log

**Transmutation** is developed with an agile methodology that I'm developing
currently called **Dex**. This methodology revolves around doing 25 minute work
sessions (inspired by the [**Pomodoro
Technique**](https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730))
and then logging what was done in that session with a work log entry.

**You can find all of the work log entries here:** [`./worklog.md`](./worklog.md)
