 - Added tests to show how to extend Transmutation using `configureTransmuter`
 - Allow control operators like `if`, `ifNo`, and `switch` take in a chain of
   transmuter transducers; currently only one can be used
 - Add path based transmuting (scope the given initial value)
 - Process operators
     - These "meta" operators have access to the full transducer array and can
       make modifications to it like logging between every step
     - Trap errors, if something breaks and it matches the trap then do X
       without breaking
     - Debug sets up logging between each step
 - Save transducer array to where it can be accessed by the outside world and
   saved or created with a base transmute chain and can be applied later
     - Apply a pipeline to values
 - Perhaps use dot-wild to introduce tricks with wildcards in paths
 - Visualization on how to do nested conditionals
 - .errorIf(path, error)
 - .errorIfNo(path, error)
 - Have switch accept an array or function
 - Documentation for each of the operators
